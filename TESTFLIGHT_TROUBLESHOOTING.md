# TestFlight Installation Troubleshooting

## Common Issue: "App Not Available or Doesn't Exist"

### 🔍 Immediate Checks

1. **Build Processing Status**
   - Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
   - Navigate to your app → TestFlight tab
   - Check build status:
     - ⏳ **Processing**: Wait 10-30 minutes
     - ⚠️ **Missing Compliance**: Need to answer export compliance
     - ❌ **Invalid**: Build has issues
     - ✅ **Ready to Test**: Should work

2. **Export Compliance (Most Common Issue)**
   - Click on your build number in TestFlight
   - Look for "Missing Compliance" warning
   - Click "Manage" or "Provide Export Compliance Information"
   - Answer: **"Does your app use encryption?"**
     - Select **"No"** (unless you added custom encryption)
   - Save

3. **Test Information Required**
   - Click on build in TestFlight
   - Add required test information:
     - **What to Test**: "Test navigation between anchor and navigator roles"
     - **Test Notes**: "Login with test credentials or create new account"
   - Save
