# Build Error Fixes Applied

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. iOS Deployment Target
**Error:** Firebase modules require iOS 15.0 minimum
**Solution:** Updated deployment target from iOS 14.0 to iOS 15.0 in project settings

### 2. Unused Variable Warning
**Error:** Variable 'self' was written to, but never read
